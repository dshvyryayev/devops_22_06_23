 1.  **Determine the narrative** by reading the pull request description and list of commits. If the commits seem to jump between topics or address, leave a comment asking for clarification or changes.
2. Lightly scan the message and **contents** of each commit, starting from the beginning of the branch. **Verify smallness and atomicity** by checking that the commit does one thing and that doesnâ€™t include any incomplete implementations. Recommend splitting or combining commits that are incorrectly scoped.
